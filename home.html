    Everyone like it's much even they are chidren or adult.The invention of ice cream can be traced 
    back to the fourth century (BC) but was never really “discovered” until the 1600’s. 
    Much about the history of ice cream has been left to the imagination but historians can give 
    credit to the chef of Charles 1 of England. After much preparation, the King's French chef had
     concocted an apparently new dish. It was cold and resembled fresh- fallen snow but was much 
     creamier and sweeter than any other after- dinner dessert. The guests were delighted, as was Charles, 
    who summoned the cook and asked him not to reveal the recipe for his frozen cream. </p>

                    in it continually stirred till it was completely frozen.
